This app started as a clone of ``django-responsive`` with some minor modifications to fit my own project requirements. So a big thank you to `@mlavin <https://github.com/mlavin>`_ for his hard work.

Shout out to `@jezdez <https://github.com/jezdez>`_ for the awesome ``django-appconf`` â€” used by this project to handle default configurations.
